(Q1) Find intersection point of Two Linked Lists
	1. brute 
		? O(N1*N2) : O(1)

	2. HashSet - push list1 in set, for list2 - check which node is present in set
		? O(N+M) : O(N)

	3. absolute diff traversal of bigger LL 
		? O(N1+N2+diff+N) : O(1)

	4. Two-pointer - Take 2 dummies, point them to head of lists, iterate over them until they collide, if anyone becomes null, point them to the head of opposite LL else go for their next
		? O(max(N1,N2)) : O(1)
